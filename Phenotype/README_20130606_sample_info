It was created based on the annotation in ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130501_sample_info/20130501_original_sample_list.xlsx

The next two files contain the same information in different formats
20130606_sample_info.txt  is a tab delimited file with 61 columns
20130606_sample_info.xlsx is a spreadsheet where the same data is split across different sheets 
in the same file

The columns are

1. Sample, Sample ID

    file, the (mapped bases - duplicated bases) was summed for each sample and divided by 2.75GB and rounded to 2dp

45. VerifyBam E Affy Chip	
46. VerifyBam LC Omni Free	
47. VerifyBam LC Affy Free	
48. VerifyBam LC Omni Chip	
49. VerifyBam LC Affy Chip	
42-49 are all values from UMich's VerifyBamID BAM QC program http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/VerifyBamID.
The Free measures use a statistical model based on the haplotypes discovered by the chip. The Chip measure considers
the genotypes available for that individual from that chip. We use greater than 3% as a cut off for our our low coverage
samples and greater than 3.5% for our exome samples.
50. LC Indel Ratio	
51. E Indel Ratio	
Both Indel ratios are the ratio of insertions to deletions found in that sample using a quick test (based on samtools)
If the ratio is higher than 5 the sample is withdrawn.
52. LC Passed QC	
53. E Passed QC	
These are binary flags showing if the sample passed QC, All samples which have passed QC have bam files. Only
samples which have both exome and low coverage data are found under ftp/data and listed in the standard alignment index
The small number of other samples are found in ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/phase3_EX_or_LC_only_alignment/
54. In Final Phase Variant Calling, Any sample which has both LC and E QC passed bams is in the final analysis set
55. Has Omni Genotypes, Omni Genotypes in ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20120131_omni_genotypes_and_intensities/Omni25_genotypes_2141_samples.b37.vcf.gz

57. Has Affy 6.0 Genotypes, Affy 6.0 Genotypes in  ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20121128_corriel_p3_sample_genotypes/

59. EBV Coverage, This was calculated by looking at the alignment of the data to NC_007605 in the low coverage bam files and using that to calculate coverage	
60. DNA Source from Coriell, This was the annotated DNA Source from Coriell	
61. Has Sequence from Blood in Index, In the later stages of the project some populations has multiple study ids, one to indicate sequencing from blood. This data for each sample has not been treated
    independently in the alignment process but when there is both LCL and Blood sourced data they are both together in single bams
